## Getting Started
To get started with the tutorial, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads). You can install 3.13 or 3.14 version.
You will also need a code editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and run your Python code. Try [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Cloning the Repository

Install git on your machine if you haven't already. You can download it from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads). On a mac you can also use homebrew to install git by running the following in your terminal.

```shell

```shell
git clone https://github.com/subinabid/EPGPPythontutorial.git
```

This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.

### Running the Code
You can run the Python code in this tutorial using the command line or terminal. Navigate to the directory where the code is located and use the following command:
```shell
python filename.py
```

OR
